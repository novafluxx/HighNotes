Key files:
- `app/composables/useNotes.ts`: Main client logic (CRUD, sync, search)
- `app/composables/useOfflineNotes.ts`: Offline queue/cache helpers
- `app/components/NoteEditor.vue`: TipTap editor
- `supabase/functions/save-note/index.ts`: Serverless note upsert/sanitization
- `types/database.types.ts`: Supabase DB types
- `nuxt.config.ts`: Nuxt, Supabase, and PWA config

---

## Configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your Supabase credentials:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

2. These are mapped to Nuxt runtime config in `nuxt.config.ts`.

---

## Supabase Functions & Database

- All backend logic is handled via Supabase Edge Functions and Postgres.
- No local Supabase CLI or DB is requiredâ€”use the [Supabase MCP](https://supabase.com/) dashboard.
- To update DB types, run:

```sh
supabase gen types typescript --project-id <your-project-id> > app/types/database.types.ts
```

---

## Development Notes

- **srcDir is `app/`**: All Nuxt app code lives in `app/`, not `src/`.
- **Offline IDs**: Notes created offline use `local-<uuid>` IDs until synced.
- **Realtime**: Subscribes to `notes:{userId}` channel for live updates.
- **Editor**: Content is sanitized both client- and server-side.
