# Feature Specification: delete-account

**Feature Branch**: `002-delete-account-the`  
**Created**: September 8, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The users needs a way to delete their account. They should be able to delete all of thier data and their account."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to delete my account and all my data so that I can remove my presence from the application and ensure my privacy.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they access the account settings and select delete account, **Then** they are prompted for confirmation.
2. **Given** a user confirms the deletion, **When** the system processes the request, **Then** all their notes and account data are permanently deleted, and they are logged out.
3. **Given** a user cancels the deletion, **When** they choose not to proceed, **Then** no data is deleted and they remain logged in.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user has offline cached data that hasn't been synced? The deletion operation should be queued and processed upon reconnection.
- How does the system handle account deletion if there are pending operations in the offline queue? The deletion should be queued after existing operations and processed in order.
- What if the deletion process fails due to network issues or server errors? The user should be notified, and the operation can be retried upon reconnection.
- How is the user notified if deletion cannot be completed? Clear error messages should be provided, and the operation should be retried automatically or manually.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an account settings page accessible to logged-in users for managing their account, including the option to delete their account.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide an accessible option for users to delete their account from the account settings page.
- **FR-003**: System MUST require explicit confirmation from the user before proceeding with account deletion.
- **FR-004**: System MUST delete all user-related data, including notes, upon account deletion.
- **FR-005**: System MUST permanently remove the user account from the system.
- **FR-006**: System MUST log the user out immediately after successful deletion.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear feedback to the user about the deletion process and its completion.
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle offline scenarios by queuing the account deletion operation until the user reconnects and the operation can be processed.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents the account holder, including authentication details and profile information.
- **Notes**: User-created content that must be deleted along with the account.
