# Research Findings: delete-account

## Decision: Leverage Supabase Auth for Account Deletion
**Rationale**: Aligns with constitution's serverless backend principle using Supabase for all authentication and data operations. The `supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser()` method provides secure, server-side account deletion.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom deletion endpoint: Rejected due to added complexity and potential security risks
- Client-side only deletion: Rejected as it violates data security principles

## Decision: Queue Offline Deletions
**Rationale**: Maintains offline-first design by queuing deletion operations when offline, ensuring consistency with existing patterns in `useOfflineNotes.ts`.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Prevent deletion when offline: Rejected as it degrades user experience
- Immediate failure: Rejected as it doesn't handle reconnection scenarios

## Decision: Cascade Delete User Data
**Rationale**: Ensures complete data removal using database foreign key constraints or explicit deletion queries, maintaining data integrity.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Soft delete: Rejected as it doesn't meet "permanent deletion" requirement
- Manual data cleanup: Rejected for maintenance complexity

## Decision: Realtime Unsubscription
**Rationale**: Automatically unsubscribe from user-specific realtime channels upon deletion to prevent unnecessary subscriptions.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep subscriptions: Rejected as it wastes resources
- Manual unsubscription: Rejected for user experience issues

## Decision: Client-side Data Cleanup
**Rationale**: Clear IndexedDB cache and queue upon successful deletion to maintain local state consistency.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Server-triggered cleanup: Rejected due to browser security restrictions
- No cleanup: Rejected as it leaves stale data</content>
