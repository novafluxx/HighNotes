# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the High Notes application from Nuxt 3.18.0 to Nuxt 4.0.0. The migration aims to leverage the latest performance improvements, enhanced developer experience, and new features available in Nuxt 4 while maintaining all existing functionality and ensuring a smooth transition with minimal breaking changes.

The High Notes application is a Progressive Web App (PWA) for note-taking built with Vue 3, Nuxt 3, Supabase for authentication and data storage, and Nuxt UI for the component library. The migration must preserve all current features while taking advantage of Nuxt 4's improvements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upgrade the application to Nuxt 4, so that I can benefit from improved performance, better developer experience, and access to the latest framework features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL run on Nuxt 4.0.0 or later
2. WHEN the application starts THEN all existing functionality SHALL work exactly as before
3. WHEN building the application THEN the build process SHALL complete successfully without errors
4. WHEN running in development mode THEN hot module replacement and dev tools SHALL function properly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all dependencies to be compatible with Nuxt 4, so that the application continues to function without compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading to Nuxt 4 THEN all existing modules SHALL be updated to compatible versions
2. WHEN the application runs THEN @nuxtjs/supabase SHALL continue to provide authentication functionality
3. WHEN the application runs THEN @nuxt/ui SHALL continue to provide UI components
4. WHEN the application runs THEN @vite-pwa/nuxt SHALL continue to provide PWA functionality
5. IF any module is incompatible THEN alternative solutions SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the configuration to be updated for Nuxt 4 compatibility, so that all settings and options work correctly with the new version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating THEN nuxt.config.ts SHALL be updated to use Nuxt 4 compatible syntax
2. WHEN the application builds THEN all configuration options SHALL be recognized and applied
3. WHEN using deprecated options THEN they SHALL be replaced with their Nuxt 4 equivalents
4. WHEN the PWA configuration is applied THEN it SHALL work with Nuxt 4's updated structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to use Nuxt 4 best practices, so that the application follows current standards and takes advantage of new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN all deprecated APIs SHALL be replaced with current alternatives
2. WHEN using auto-imports THEN they SHALL work correctly with Nuxt 4's updated system
3. WHEN using composables THEN they SHALL follow Nuxt 4 patterns and conventions
4. WHEN accessing route metadata THEN it SHALL use the updated Nuxt 4 approach

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing features to continue working after the migration, so that my note-taking experience remains uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging in THEN authentication SHALL work exactly as before
2. WHEN creating, editing, or deleting notes THEN all CRUD operations SHALL function properly
3. WHEN using the PWA features THEN offline functionality and installation SHALL work
4. WHEN navigating between pages THEN routing SHALL work without issues
5. WHEN using the dark/light theme toggle THEN it SHALL continue to function properly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of changes made during migration, so that I understand what was modified and why.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all configuration changes SHALL be documented
2. WHEN code is modified THEN the reasons for changes SHALL be clear
3. WHEN new patterns are introduced THEN they SHALL be explained
4. WHEN deprecated features are replaced THEN the alternatives SHALL be documented
