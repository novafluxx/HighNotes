# Requirements Document

## Introduction

High Notes needs a comprehensive testing framework to ensure application stability and functionality, particularly after dependency upgrades. The testing strategy should cover both unit-level component testing and end-to-end user workflows to catch regressions early and maintain confidence in the application's reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated unit tests for composables and components, so that I can quickly identify breaking changes when upgrading dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN composable functions are called with valid inputs THEN the system SHALL return expected outputs and maintain correct state
2. WHEN composable functions are called with invalid inputs THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error states
3. WHEN Vue components are rendered with props THEN the system SHALL display correct content and respond to user interactions
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update UI components accordingly
5. IF a dependency upgrade breaks a composable THEN the unit tests SHALL fail and identify the specific issue

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want end-to-end tests for critical user workflows, so that I can verify the entire application works correctly after dependency updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and display their notes
2. WHEN a user creates a new note THEN the system SHALL save it to the database and display it in the notes list
3. WHEN a user edits an existing note THEN the system SHALL update the content and persist changes
4. WHEN a user deletes a note THEN the system SHALL remove it from the database and update the UI
5. WHEN a user searches for notes THEN the system SHALL filter and display matching results
6. IF any critical workflow fails THEN the tests SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what broke

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests for Supabase interactions, so that I can ensure database operations work correctly after backend or client library updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application connects to Supabase THEN the system SHALL establish a valid connection
2. WHEN CRUD operations are performed on notes THEN the system SHALL interact correctly with the database
3. WHEN authentication operations are performed THEN the system SHALL communicate properly with Supabase Auth
4. WHEN real-time subscriptions are established THEN the system SHALL receive updates correctly
5. IF Supabase client library changes break functionality THEN the integration tests SHALL detect the issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a test runner that integrates with the existing development workflow, so that I can run tests easily during development and CI/CD processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL provide clear pass/fail results with detailed output
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages and stack traces
3. WHEN running in watch mode THEN the system SHALL re-run relevant tests when files change
4. WHEN generating coverage reports THEN the system SHALL show which code paths are tested
5. IF tests are run in CI environment THEN the system SHALL integrate with build processes and fail builds on test failures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test utilities and fixtures, so that I can write tests efficiently without duplicating setup code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing component tests THEN the system SHALL provide utilities for mounting components with required providers
2. WHEN writing tests that need authentication THEN the system SHALL provide mock user states and authentication helpers
3. WHEN writing tests that need database data THEN the system SHALL provide test fixtures and data seeding utilities
4. WHEN writing tests that need Supabase mocking THEN the system SHALL provide mock implementations for testing
5. IF test setup becomes complex THEN the utilities SHALL simplify and standardize the process
